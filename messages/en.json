I chose to integrate a mockup found on Dribbble:link=https://dribbble.com/ and to make it fully functional.% The user can authenticate via a Google:link=https://www.google.com/ account, and this system was implemented using NextAuth:link=https://next-auth.js.org/ which manages authentication and sessions. On the homepage, users can find products currently on sale. If they wish, they can add them to their favorites.% They can also perform a search using a search bar to find a specific product. An extension of PostgreSQL:link=https://www.postgresql.org/ has been added to enable more efficient product searches.% The user can also add a product to their cart, remove it, or increase or decrease the quantity. Then, if they wish, they can proceed to checkout and place an order.% To do this, they must enter their shipping information through an interactive interface. Once that is done, they can pay for their order using a Stripe payment form:link=https://stripe.com/fr to secure payments.% If the order is confirmed, the user is redirected to an order confirmation page."

Many thanks to them for their trust, and especially to my internship supervisor, Mr. Asselin:link=https://www.linkedin.com/in/basselin/, who taught me a great deal.% On this site, users can explore the services offered by the company, the projects they’ve completed, and an OpenStreetMap:link=https://www.openstreetmap.org/ map to locate them.% I also used the Leaflet:link=https://leafletjs.com/ library to integrate the map and make it interactive. Users can zoom in, zoom out, and move around the map."

I chose to create a music player that integrates the Spotify:link=https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api. API.% This project allowed me to explore this API and understand how it works.% To use the application, the user must authenticate via a Spotify account and launch the app on a Spotify-compatible device.% The user can then listen to their favorite tracks, which I retrieve by making requests to the API.% The user can play, pause, skip tracks, restart them, and adjust the volume.% Although this project is not yet complete, it has given me valuable experience in working with the Spotify:link=https://open.spotify.com/ API and a deeper understanding of its functionality."
