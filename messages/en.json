I chose to integrate a mockup found on Dribbble:link=https://dribbble.com/ and to make it fully functional.% The user can authenticate via a Google:link=https://www.google.com/ account, and this system was implemented using NextAuth:link=https://next-auth.js.org/ which manages authentication and sessions. On the homepage, users can find products currently on sale. If they wish, they can add them to their favorites.% They can also perform a search using a search bar to find a specific product. An extension of PostgreSQL:link=https://www.postgresql.org/ has been added to enable more efficient product searches.% The user can also add a product to their cart, remove it, or increase or decrease the quantity. Then, if they wish, they can proceed to checkout and place an order.% To do this, they must enter their shipping information through an interactive interface. Once that is done, they can pay for their order using a Stripe payment form:link=https://stripe.com/fr to secure payments.% If the order is confirmed, the user is redirected to an order confirmation page."
